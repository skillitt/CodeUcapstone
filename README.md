# Cybersecurity Attacks Visualization

This project provides visualizations of a cleaned cybersecurity attacks dataset using Python. The visualizations include a bar plot of the number of attacks per year, a heatmap of the correlation matrix of numerical features, and a line plot showing the trend of attacks over time.

## Getting Started

To run this code and view the visualizations, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

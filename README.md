# Cybersecurity Attacks Visualization

This project provides visualizations of a cleaned cybersecurity attacks dataset using Python. The visualizations include a bar plot of the number of attacks per year, a heatmap of the correlation matrix of numerical features, and a line plot showing the trend of attacks over time.

#### ABOUT THIS CODE

There are two parts to this code, you can just run the capstone.py
or if you want you can delete the merged_datasets.csv and run the 
merge_datasets.py and it will output the merged_datasets.csv

## Getting Started

To run this code and view the visualizations, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Running the Code
macOS/Linux
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/skillitt/CodeUcapstone
Navigate to the project directory:
python capstone.py


Windows
Clone the repository:
cmd
git clone https://github.com/skillitt/CodeUcapstone
Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repository
Run the Python script:
python capstone.py

#### Create virtual enviroment & Install the Requirements

Linux/Mac
Create - python3 -m venv venv
Activate - source venv/bin/activate
Install - pip install -r requirements.txt
Deactivate - deactivate

GitBash

Install - pip install -r requirements.txt
Deactivate - deactivate

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

#### Merge & Clean Data

Run merge_datasets.py
This will create the merge_datasets.csv


#### Visualizations
Bar Plot: Shows the number of cybersecurity attacks per year.
Heatmap: Displays the correlation matrix of numerical features in the dataset.
Line Plot: Illustrates the trend of cybersecurity attacks over time.

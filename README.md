# Cybersecurity Attacks Visualization

This project provides visualizations of a cleaned cybersecurity attacks dataset using Python. The visualizations include a bar plot of the number of attacks per year, a heatmap of the correlation matrix of numerical features, and a line plot showing the trend of attacks over time.

## Getting Started

To run this code and view the visualizations, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

The necessary dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Running the Code
macOS/Linux
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/skillitt/CodeUcapstone
Navigate to the project directory:
python capstone.py


Windows
Clone the repository:

cmd
git clone https://github.com/skillitt/CodeUcapstone
Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repository
Run the Python script:
python capstone.py

#### INSTALL Dependencies

Open the terminal in VS Code by going to View > Terminal.
Ensure your virtual environment is activated. If you don't have a virtual environment, you can create one using:

python -m venv venv
On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Visualizations
Bar Plot: Shows the number of cybersecurity attacks per year.
Heatmap: Displays the correlation matrix of numerical features in the dataset.
Line Plot: Illustrates the trend of cybersecurity attacks over time.
